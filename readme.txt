Fullscreen background images and background slideshows on any WordPress
post or page. Easily upload and select images using the media library.


== Description ==

Easily create full screen image backgrounds and fading slideshows that stretch
and adapt to the size of your page.

You can either use it as a global "cover" style background that will be
displayed on all pages and posts of your WordPress website or you can give
individual posts or pages their own specific background – great for giving
parts of a website a whole different look.

Jellyfish Backdrop makes fullscreen background slideshows easy by allowing
you to assign multiple backgrounds to any page or post.

* Unlimited number of post and slideshows.
* Create different slideshows or backgrounds or different areas of your site.
* Easy to use admin panels with sortable images and media library integration.
* Display images in any page element allowing slideshows anywhere, not just as
a background!

= Demo =

See the plugin homepage for demos and full details:

== Installation ==

Either install and activate the plugin via your WordPress Admin

Or

Extract the zip file and just drop the contents in the wp-content/plugins/
directory of your WordPress installation and then activate the Plugin from
Plugins page.

After the plugin is activated you'll find a new Backdrop Slideshow settings
page under the Settings menu of your WordPress admin. Here you can configure
the global options.


== Usage ==

Visit the settings page to set up the global and default options. Here you'll
be able to set up a default background image that will be displayed on every
page of your blog, enable or disable the global background or individual post
and page background support as well as set up the default options.

To add a unique background image or slideshow to a specific post or page,
first make sure the *Enable Post and Page Slideshows* option is checked on the
settings page. You'll now find a new area on the post / page edit screens
where you can add images to the Backdrop Slideshow and alter fade time,
slide display time and where the images will appear. Jellyfish Backdrop uses
the WordPress image uploader and Media Library, so it's easy to choose the
images you want to use. You can also reorder the images by dragging.
Once you've finished adding and arranging your images, be sure to save the
post or your changes will not be saved.

Page / Post backgrounds will override the default background so it's possible
to define one background to be used site wide and another on a specific page.

By default images are shown as the main page background (body), however you
can make the images appear as backgrounds to other areas of the page by
supplying any valid element id or classname in the Container field on the
admin page. eg. #main, .header


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why does the slideshow appear under my page content? =
This is what it's primarily intended to do, how this appears on your site
depends on the theme you are using. It works best on theme pages with large
areas of little content.

= Can I use this as a normal slideshow? =
Yes, create a div element or other suitable container on your page and configure
your slideshow to use the element's id or class. Make sure you've styled the
element to give it a suitable size.

= Can I have a default slideshow that shows on every page? =
No, slideshows must be defined on an individual post or page basis.
